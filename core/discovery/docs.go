Package discovery is responsible for:
 - handling discovery related communications
 - keeping track of currently active proposals in local storage
 - finding and filtering proposals in local storage


Proposal storage filtering can be done with ProposalReducer callbacks.
ProposalReducer is simple callback which is run against list of proposals.
Proposal storage filtering is performed with discovery.Finder:
```
finder := discovery.NewFinder(discovery.NewStorage())
proposal, err := finder.GetProposal(market.ProposalID{ServiceType: "streaming", ProviderID: "0x1"})
proposals, err = finder.MatchProposals(reducer.Equal(reducer.ProviderID, "0x2"))
```

- Most simple noop reducer:
```
finder.MatchProposals(
  reducer.All(),
)
```
- By proposal field:
```
finder.MatchProposals(
  reducer.EqualString(reducer.ProviderID, "0x1"),
)
```
- By custom callback:
```
finder.MatchProposals(func(proposal market.ServiceProposal) bool {
  return proposal.ProviderID == "0x3" || proposal.ServiceType == "wireguard"
})
```
- By several conditions:
```
finder.MatchProposals(reducer.And(
  reducer.EqualString(reducer.ProviderID, "0x1"),
  reducer.InString(reducer.ServiceType, "openvpn", "wireguard")),
  reducer.AccessPolicy("mysterium", ""),
))
```
- By nesting several conditions:
```
finder.MatchProposals(reducer.Or(
  reducer.And(
    reducer.EqualString(reducer.ServiceType, "wireguard"),
    reducer.InString(reducer.Country, "US", "CA"),
    reducer.EqualString(reducer.IPType, "residential"),
  ),
  reducer.And(
    reducer.EqualString(reducer.ServiceType, "openvpn"),
    reducer.Or(
      reducer.EqualString(reducer.Country, "US")),
      reducer.EqualString(reducer.Country, "CA")),
    ),
    reducer.Not(reducer.EqualString(reducer.IPType, "datacenter")),
  )
))
```
